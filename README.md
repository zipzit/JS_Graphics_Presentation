# JS_Graphics_Presentation
Graphics presentation package for Las Vegas JavaScript Meetup Group
Meetup 22 Sept 2015, Las Vegas NV.

I'd like to talk about graphics for browser applications

- Why graphics?
- What tools are out there?
- How do they work (DOM/CSS vs SVG vs canvas)?
- How do you know which tool to use when?

After that I'd like to discuss the mechanism walker stuff, and how that relates to Graphics

Demos:

- 3d mechanism overview
- mouse events in Canvas
- theory of CAD Slide
- TubeNotcher Application (including printouts on paper)

Things I learned:
- Lots of little JS tidbits on info.
